    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My grandmother's recipe for roasted chicken. We are German and she used to do it this way all the time. I never
        have had a chicken this juicy before; this little trick works and makes the people eating it go silent. It's
        funny. We nibble on the celery after.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, giblets removed</li>
        <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon onion powder, or to taste</li>
        <li>Â½ cup margarine, divided</li>
        <li>1 stalk celery, leaves removed</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place chicken in a roasting pan, and season generously inside and out with salt and pepper. Sprinkle inside
            and out with onion powder. Place 3 tablespoons margarine in the chicken cavity. Arrange dollops of the
            remaining margarine around the chicken's exterior. Cut the celery into 3 or 4 pieces, and place in the
            chicken cavity.</li>
        <li>Bake chicken uncovered in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear,
            about 1 hour and 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near
            the bone, should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Remove from heat and baste with melted margarine and
            drippings. Cover with aluminum foil and allow to rest about 30 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
